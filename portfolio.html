      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="about-text">
        Hi, I’m Shivani, a passionate and dedicated developer with a flair for solving real-world problems through technology. 
        Currently pursuing my IT engineering, I specialize in blending innovation with purpose. From creating inclusive educational 
        games for dyslexic children to optimizing agricultural practices with AI, my projects focus on impact-driven solutions.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        I thrive at the intersection of creativity and logic, exploring diverse technologies like MERN stack, AI/ML, and Blockchain 
        to bring meaningful ideas to life. Whether it's gamifying constitutional literacy or designing platforms for freelancers, 
        my goal is to make technology accessible and empowering for everyone.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        When I’m not coding, you can find me engaging in public speaking at 'Vachan,' brainstorming sustainable solutions, 
        or curating innovative gameplay experiences.
